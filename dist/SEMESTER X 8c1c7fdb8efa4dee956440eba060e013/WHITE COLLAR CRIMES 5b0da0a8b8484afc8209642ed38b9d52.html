                                "Every accused shall be presumed to be innocent till proved guilty." How far is this principle relevant in tackling
                                socio-economic offences ?

                                In the current times, when India is witnessing a violent upsurge in crimes, and specifically brutal crimes like rape, the
                                country has felt the need to establish a more deterrent approach towards justice delivery. The lawmakers have recently
                                introduced provisions which put the accused on the pedestal where to get free he has to prove his innocence rather than the
                                prosecution discharging the proof. However, there are certain principles in the criminal justice system that can never be
                                overlooked. If neglected they will only lead to miscarriage of justice. Presumption of innocence is one such principle.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>What is presumption of Innocence?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Presumption is a legal rule that allows a court to assume a fact is true unless there
                                <br />
                                is evidence to the contrary. Presumption of Innocence is a legal principle that every person accused of any crime is considered
                                innocent until proven guilty. According to this principle, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to present compelling
                                evidence to the trier of fact. If prosecution fails to prove guilt, the accused is acquitted of the charges. The prosecution
                                must prove the guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This right is both a legal and international right.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The principle is also supported by international human rights conventions, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                                (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which both recognize the right to be presumed
                                innocent until proven guilty.&nbsp;This principle is essential in ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected and that
                                the legal system is fair and just.
                            </p>

                                Common law is based on Actus non Facit reum, Nisi Mens Sit Rea. According to this actus reus (prohibited act) is not sufficient
                                to constitute offence unless it is caused with guilty mind. This is also known as “Fault Liability.” The principle of
                                presumption of innocence is part of this concept. Just opposite of “Fault Liability”, there is “Strict Liability”. There are
                                certain cases in which there is no requirement of mens rea. Many of the socio economic offences fall under the category of
                                strict liabilty

                            <p>
                                Socio-economic offences are violations of regulations and laws that govern economic and social activities. These crimes often
                                involve dishonest or illegal methods to pursue financial gain. Examples include fraud, money laundering, tax fraud, bribery,
                                embezzlement, insider trading and corruption.

                                    Firstly, this category of crimes involve an economic aspect (like trade, business, tax, etc.) abused by any person,

                                    an emotional reaction against a particular victim. It involves non-emotional triggers such as greed and avarice instead of
                                    hate, vengeance, or lust as found in traditional crimes, like murder, rape, etc.

                                The three implications are found in both socio-economic and white-collar offenses, but the scope of white collar crimes is
                                narrower since the scope of white collar crimes are only for crimes done by people who belong to the higher strata of society.
                                Every white collar crime is a socio economic offence but not every socio economic offence is a white collar crime.

                            <p>Socio-economic offences are characterised by several distinctive features:</p>

                                    Perpetrators are typically motivated by extreme greed or a desire for riches, unlike traditional crimes driven by emotional
                                    reasons.

                            <p>
                                Socio-economic offences in India encompass a broad range of illegal activities that have both social and economic implications.
                                These offences not only hinder the country’s economic development but also undermine its social fabric. The Law Commission of
                                India, in its 29th and 47th reports, categorised these offences into various groups to better understand and address them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a similar case of Nimmagadda Prasad v. CBI,13 the appellant was accused of committing economic offence of allocating some
                                lands to chosen private companies under the veil of development with deception. The court held that socio-economic crimes unlike
                                other crimes are executed with deliberate design and calculations and with an objective of personnel benefit without regard to
                                the harmful consequences to the community or society. The court held that bail should not be granted.

                            <p>Here’s a brief overview of the different types of socio-economic offences as outlined in these reports:</p>
                            <h3><strong>Offences Impeding Economic Development</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                This category includes crimes that directly obstruct the country’s economic progress, posing a threat to its economic health.
                                Examples could include large-scale frauds, financial scams and activities that disrupt market stability.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Tax Evasion</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                This category encompasses offences related to the evasion of taxes, which deprive the government of essential revenue needed for
                                public services and infrastructure development. It includes underreporting income, falsifying deductions and smuggling to avoid
                                customs duties.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Misuse of Public Office</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Offences in this category involve public servants abusing their positions for personal gain. This can include bribery,
                                corruption and nepotism, which erode public trust in government institutions.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Breach of Contracts and Specifications</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                This category covers offences similar to breaches of contract, resulting in the delivery of goods that do not meet specified
                                standards. This can affect consumer safety and market integrity.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Hoarding and Black Marketing</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                These offences involve the illegal stockpiling and selling of goods at inflated prices, often during shortages or crises. This
                                can lead to artificial scarcity and exploitation of consumers.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Adulteration of Food and Drugs</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                This category includes crimes related to the contamination or dilution of food and pharmaceutical products, which can pose
                                severe health risks to the public.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Theft and Misappropriation of Public Property</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Offences in this category involve the illegal appropriation or theft of government assets and funds, which can significantly
                                impact public resources and services.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Trafficking in Licenses and Permits</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                This category encompasses offences related to the illegal trade or manipulation of licenses and permits, often to bypass
                                regulations or gain undue advantages in various sectors.
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>
                                Addressing these socio-economic offences is crucial for ensuring the country’s overall development and maintaining social
                                justice. Effective legal frameworks, robust enforcement mechanisms and public awareness are essential to combat these crimes and
                                protect the nation’s economic and social well-being.

                            <h1>Presumption in relation to Socio Economic Offences</h1>
                            <p>
                                The application of this principle in the context of socio-economic offenses requires a balanced approach, considering the
                                potential impact of such offenses on society and the need for effective law enforcement. Socio-economic offenses often involve
                                complex financial transactions, corporate malpractices, or violations of regulatory frameworks that can have far-reaching
                                consequences for the economy, public welfare, and the rights of individuals. The accused parties, particularly in high-profile
                                cases, often have substantial legal and financial resources. This can lead to prolonged legal battles, potentially straining the
                                resources of the prosecution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In India, the burden of proof may shift to the accused due to the nature of the certain crimes and the difficulty in obtaining
                                evidence. The 47th Law report suggested that socio-economic offences must be treated differently fromtraditional crime. In such
                                offences, mens rea should not be required. The burden of disproving mens rea should lie over accused. Socio economic offences
                                represent greater harm. There are many acts on socio economic offences where the presuption of innocence is not assumed.
                            </p>
                            <p>Here are some legislations against socio economic offences where the burden of proof lies on the accused -</p>

                            <p>
                                Almost all societies have certain norms, beliefs, customs and traditions which are implicitly accepted by its members as
                                conducive to their well being and healthy development. infringement of these cherished norms and customs condemned as
                                anti-social behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, many writers have defined 'crime' as anti-social, immoral or sinful behavior. However, according to the legal
                                definition&nbsp;
                                <strong>crime</strong>
                                &nbsp;is any form of conduct which is declared to be socially harmful in a state and as such forbidden by law under pain of some
                                punishment. Crime can be defined as an act or omission, which is unlawful, illegal or infringes provisions of law and which is
                                punishable by law. White-collar crimes are non-violent, financially motivated crimes committed by individuals or organizations,
                                often involving deceit, concealment, or breach of trust.

                            <p>
                                The concept of&nbsp;white-collar crime&nbsp;found its place in criminology for the first time in 1941 when Sutherland first
                                published his research paper on white-collar criminality in the American sociological review. he defined white-collar crime as
                                a&nbsp;crime committed by persons of high social status in course of their occupation. eg- misrepresentation through fraudulent
                                advertisement, infringement of patents, copyrights, and trade-marks, a publication of fabricated balance sheets and profit and
                                loss account of business, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>“White-collar crimes are committed by persons of status, not for need but for greed”</p>
                            <p>-Sir Walter Reckless</p>
                            <p>
                                Sutherland further pointed out that white-collar crime is more harmful to society than ordinary crimes because the financial
                                loss to the society from white-collar crime is far greater than the financial loss from traditional criminal activities such as
                                robbery.

                            <p>
                                The government of India has three organs, the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary and the constitution provide
                                separation of powers to each branch as they perform their functions independently. The legislators or law makers are elected
                                representatives of the people their duty is to frame clear, simple and effective laws. These ministers are accountable to the
                                legislatures which are also elected by the people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ministers are at the top of the hierarchy of the executive branch. The popular case of corruption was the 2G spectrum scam which
                                sent A. Raja, telecom minister to jail along with another DMK law-maker. Sukhram was another minister in the nineties in the
                                same ministry to go to jail. Fodder scam in Bihar is another scandal for which Laloo Yadav is being tried. But such kinds of
                                exposures and trials are rare in India, often only the smaller fishes get caught.

                                    : Bureaucrats accepting bribes or other forms of corruption to influence their decisions or actions. This can involve
                                    accepting money, gifts, or other benefits in exchange for favorable treatment, such as granting licenses, permits, or
                                    contracts. Bureaucrats may also accept bribes to ignore or overlook violations of laws or regulations.

                            <h2><strong>Criminalization of Politics</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                The criminalization of politics in India refers to the increasing involvement of individuals with criminal backgrounds in the
                                political sphere. This trend has been observed at both the national and state levels, with a significant number of elected
                                representatives facing criminal charges. According to the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), 40% of sitting Members of
                                Parliament (MPs) and 30% of Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) have criminal cases against them
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                .The presence of individuals with criminal histories in politics has far-reaching consequences. It undermines the rule of law,
                                as those who are supposed to create and uphold laws may also be lawbreakers. This can lead to policies being formulated to serve
                                personal interests rather than the greater good. The criminalization of politics also fosters a culture of intimidation and
                                fear, which can be used to silence opposition and maintain power
                            </p>
                            <p>.</p>
                            <h2><strong>Ethical Violations</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                Ethical violations among legislators in India are another significant concern. The Committee on Ethics of the Rajya Sabha and
                                the Lok Sabha have established guidelines for the ethical conduct of members. These guidelines emphasize the importance of
                                maintaining high standards of morality, dignity, and decency in public life. Members are expected to utilize their position to
                                advance the general well-being of the people, avoid conflicts of interest, and refrain from misusing their power and resources
                                for personal gain
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                .Despite these guidelines, ethical violations persist. Legislators have been known to engage in activities that bring disrepute
                                to Parliament, such as giving false certificates or lending support to causes without proper knowledge. They may also misuse
                                public resources, disclose confidential information, or disrespect religious values. These actions erode the credibility of the
                                legislative process and undermine the trust of citizens in their elected representatives
                            </p>

                            <h2><strong>Corruption</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                Corruption is a pervasive problem in India, and legislators are not immune to it. Corruption can take many forms, including
                                bribery, embezzlement, and the abuse of power for personal gain. The lack of accountability and transparency in government
                                agencies and institutions enables corrupt practices to persist. According to Transparency International's 2023 Corruption
                                Perceptions Index, India scored 39 out of 100, ranking 93rd among 180 countries
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                .Corruption among legislators can manifest in various ways. They may accept bribes to influence policy decisions or to expedite
                                services. They may also engage in corrupt practices such as the misuse of government funds, the allocation of contracts to
                                favored individuals or companies, or the manipulation of regulatory processes for personal benefit. Corruption can also lead to

                                The deviance by legislators in India has significant consequences for the country's democracy and governance. The

                                Corruption has existed in India for centuries. It begins with opportunistic leaders who see any task that comes to them as a
                                chance to gain money. Corruption is seen as one of the most significant barriers to advancement, particularly in developing
                                nations such as India, and particularly in government agencies.

                                Initially, the Indian Penal Code, of 1860 dealt with bribery and corruption in situations involving public servants inside the
                                Indian Justice System. However, it was seen throughout the 1945s that the then-existing law was insufficient to handle the
                                exigencies, and an issue was felt to establish unique laws with bribery and corruption, so the Prevention of Corruption Act, of
                                1947 was adopted impressively. The 1947 Act was later amended twice, first by the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1952 and then by
                                the Anti-Corruption Laws (Amendment) Act of 1964, both of which were based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee.

                                The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (POCA) was established to consolidate all existing laws and combat corruption in
                                government agencies and prosecute and punish public workers who engage in corrupt acts. It incorporated the Prevention of
                                Corruption Act, 1947, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952, and Section 161 to 165-A of the Indian Penal Code with
                                modifications. There were significant amendments to the Act made in 2018 to strengthen and add provisions.

                                <strong>Section 7</strong>
                                &nbsp;allows public servants to receive rewards other than lawful pay in exchange for doing an official act. However, it is
                                crucial that a demand for gratification must be made by the public servant, and that mere possession of the valuable property,
                                in the absence of proof of such demand, may not result in guilt under Section 7 of this Act. The term&nbsp;

                                Without evidence of demand, the mere possession and seizure of cash from a subject of an inquiry do not constitute a violation

                                A public servant who accepts or obtains any bribe as a motive or reward for performing or abstaining from performing an official
                                act.
                            </p>
                            <p>Section 8 states “Any person who gives or promises to give an undue advantage to another person or persons, with intention</p>

                                &nbsp;is used throughout the provision and has been determined to apply to both public workers and non-public servants.

                                &nbsp;is that Section 8 allows the use of&nbsp; “personal influence” to secure favour or disfavour, whereas Section 9
                                contemplates the use of “corrupt or criminal methods.” Although Section 8 uses the term “corrupt,” it is not defined in the
                                Prevention of Corruption Act.

                            <p>
                                The 2018 amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act introduced several significant changes aimed at strengthening the
                                anti-corruption framework:

                                    <strong>Inclusion of Commercial Organizations:</strong>
                                    The amendments brought commercial organizations within the ambit of the law, making it an offence for them to give or offer
                                    bribes to public servants to gain business advantages.

                                    The amendments increased the minimum and maximum penalties for various offences to ensure stricter punishment for corrupt
                                    practices.

                                    The amendments provided protection for individuals who report bribery within a stipulated time frame, encouraging
                                    whistleblowers to come forward without fear of retribution.

                                    The amendments introduced specific timelines for the completion of trial proceedings to ensure speedy justice. This is
                                    crucial in ensuring that corruption cases are resolved promptly, reducing the backlog of cases.

                                India is the largest democracy in the world and owing to its status it is important that its constitution uphold the basic
                                essence of democracy as a whole. The constitution does so by protecting the most basic civic and human liberties of its citizens
                                in the form of the fundamental rights as enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution.

                                One such fundamental right which forms an integral part of the right to freedom is&nbsp;
                                <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/581566/">Article 22 of the Indian constitution</a>
                                &nbsp;which ensures all persons protection against arrest and detention in certain cases. Therefore, this fundamental right is
                                available to both citizens and non-citizens just the same against any arrest or detention made against them by a capricious or
                                arbitrary exercise of power.

                                The importance of the article as an indispensable part of the fundamental rights can be seen by the presence of this right in

                            <h3>Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1293832/">Article 22(1)</a>

                                arrest as soon as possible.
                            </p>

                                This clearly portrays that no arrest can be made because it is lawful for the police to do so. Every arrest requires reason and
                                justification, apart and distinct from the power to arrest. In view of this, it was held in the case of&nbsp;
                                <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/768175/">Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P.</a>
                                &nbsp;that a detained person should know the cause of his detention and is entitled to let any third person know the location of
                                his detention.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Article 22(1) also states that any person who is arrested has the right to consult at all times and be defended by a lawyer of
                                his own choice. This right is expanded right from the moment of the person’s arrest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Further, the court also holds a constitutional obligation to provide free legal aid to every indigent person under trial.
                                Although this right is not mentioned under the purview of Article 22, it still witnesses a direct mention under&nbsp;
                                <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1331994/">Article 39(A)</a>

                                , where the Bar Association of Coimbatore passed a resolution that none of its members would defend the policemen who had
                                allegedly assaulted some lawyers. Such resolutions stood illegal as the court observed that every person, regardless of the type
                                of accusations on him, had a right to be defended in a court of law.

                                &nbsp;ensures the right of the accused to be produced before a magistrate. When a person is arrested, the person or police
                                officer making the arrest should bring the arrested person before a magistrate or judicial officer without any unnecessary

                            <h3>No detention beyond 24 hours except by order of the Magistrate</h3>
                            <p>
                                Article 22(2) and Section 76 of the CrPc states that no person who is arrested should be detained for more than 24 hours without
                                being produced before a magistrate or judicial authority and getting the detention authorized. The mentioned 24 hours exclude
                                the time of travel from the place of arrest to the magistrate’s court. This provision helps to keep a check on the investigation
                                of the police regarding the matter at hand. It protects the accused from being trapped into wrongful detention.

                                , this right was infringed and thus the victim was provided compensation as constitutional remedy. It was held that cases of
                                arrest without warrant require greater protection and production of the accused within 24 hours ensures the legality of the
                                arrest, not complying with which would deem the arrest unlawful.

                                months unless; an advisory board reports a sufficient cause for such detention. The people on the advisory board should be

                                According to the Constitution, the police is a state-run body. As a result, each of the 28 states has its own law enforcement
                                agency. The Centre will also keep its own police forces to help states uphold law and order. As a result, it continues to
                                perform a variety of specialized functions in seven Central Policing and many other police organizations, including intelligence
                                collection, investigations, research, recordkeeping, and education. Police forces play a vital role in maintaining and
                                implementing laws, prosecuting crimes, and ensuring national safety and security.
                            </p>

                                The police are an exclusive subject under the State List. Any police law can be enacted by a state legislature. However, the
                                police have become puppets for politicians. The police Act of 1861, enacted by the British to quell dissent, is still in force
                                in India. Now, India has become a political and economic superpower, but the police remain paralysed. At the same time, the
                                police face many challenges and issues, which makes necessary for changes in the police administration. For which, Hon’ble
                                Supreme Court of India has issued many guidelines for reforms of Police.

                                Several attempts to implement serious police reforms have been made over the past thirty years. The National Policing Committee
                                published eight findings between 1978 and 1981, making various recommendations but taking no steps to put them into effect. .
                                The committee recommended that the State Security Commission be established in all the states, as well as that the investigation
                                process be independent of all outside influence, that the police chief be given a fixed term, and, most importantly, that the
                                new Police Act to be framed and drafted.

                                The Ribeiro committee issued two findings, proposing the creation of an advisory role and making recommendations to the Police
                                Performance and Accountability Commission. It recommended the creation of District Police Claims and Police Establishment
                                Boards, which would oversee additional aspects of police administration.

                            <p>The Indian Constitution and administrative law provide the foundation for public law liability in relation to police forces.</p>
                            <p>
                                Beginning in the early 1980s, a series of Supreme Court decisions established basic concepts that established monetary
                                compensation as an important remedy for holding a state accountable for police misconduct and misuse of power.

                                (1983), in which the Supreme Court’s three- judge bench exercised writ jurisdiction and issued an order to indemnify for
                                violations of Articles 21 and 22 of the Indian Constitution, can be considered a precedent. In this case, the petitioner had
                                been wrongly imprisoned for 14 years following his acquittal. He sought restitution for wrongful incarceration, claiming that
                                his arrest was completely unjustified. Although the petitioner was entitled to demand compensation in a regular civil case,
                                the&nbsp;Supreme Court ruled that it would not merely do justice by issuing a warrant for release and instead had the authority
                                to appeal compensation to the State Government.

                                , the Supreme Court awarded compensation to the claimant for his unlawfully detained by police. Bhim Singh was a member of the
                                State Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. Its aim was to prevent him from attending the Legislative Assembly session
                                scheduled for September 11, 1985, while he was in illegal custody. The court concluded that “there was a clear violation Article
                                21 and 22(2) by the police officers, who were in turn executing the orders they had received from higher echelons (people from

                            <p>
                                Sections 197 and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) have been preserved to offer protection to police officers. Section
                                197 demands that permission be obtained from the Central or State Government before any disciplinary action is taken against a
                                police officer accused of committing a criminal offence. Similarly, Section 132 forbids the government from suing police
                                officers for any act allegedly committed under Criminal Procedure Code sections 129 to 131, “which deal with controlling an
                                unlawful meeting that is alleged to have caused a breach of peace.”

                                <strong>P.P. Unnikrishnan v. Puttiyottil Alikutty</strong>
                                ,” two police officers were accused of unlawfully detaining and torturing a complainant for several days. The Supreme Court’s
                                division bench had to deal with a contention raised by police officers under Section 64 of the Kerala Police Act, which provides
                                procedural safeguards against legal proceedings brought against police officers. According to the Supreme Court, this clause is
                                based on the reasoning of Section 197 of the Cr.P.C.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a result, the Supreme Court stated in its discussion, the scope of Section 197(1) that, “There must be a reasonable
                                connection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act must bear such relation to the duty that the accused
                                could lay a reasonable, but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did it in the course of the performance of his duty.”

                            <p>
                                Based on the precedents, the following conclusions can be drawn. The procedural safeguard provided by Section 197 Cr.P.C.
                                applies only if the offender police officer may demonstrate that the alleged criminal act was committed while performing
                                official duties.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, we can see the how the Supreme Court gave guidelines on police reforms. The Supreme Court can only recommend for a
                                new guidelines and legislations to be passed on police reforms and also cannot implement it. It is the duty of the legislature
                                and the executive to enforce these recommendations, this is not done properly in many staaates.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only way the supreme court can help if these recommendations don’t work out is in way of precedents which woud give some
                                sort of immediate relief for actions done by police.

                                In India, the exercise of police power is subject to legal restraints to ensure the protection of citizens' rights and prevent
                                abuse of authority. The structures of legal restraint on police power in India include:

                                    : The Indian Constitution provides several safeguards to protect individuals from arbitrary exercise of police power. These
                                    include the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21), protection against self-incrimination (Article 20), and the

                                    guidelines for the arrest, detention, and investigation of crimes, ensuring that police actions are carried out within the

                                    : The judiciary plays a crucial role in overseeing and restraining police power. Courts have the power to issue writs, such
                                    as habeas corpus, mandamus, and certiorari, to ensure that police actions are lawful and in accordance with constitutional
                                    provisions. Judicial review acts as a check on police excesses and provides remedies for violations of fundamental rights.

                                The Police Act of 1861 largely governs Indian police forces. The Police Act gives each State Government the power to establish

                                in the law and order problems of the State because the Centre is under a duty to protect the States from internal disturbances.
                                Primarily it is the duty of the State govt. to maintain the civilian police force. Besides the state police force there are
                                certain police force establishments at the Union level.

                                anti-corruption authority constituted at the state level and it investigates allegations of corruption and mal-administration in
                                contradiction of public servants and is tasked with speedy redressal of public grievances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The origin of the Lokayukta can be drawn to the Ombudsmen in Scandinavian countries. The Administrative Reforms Commission,
                                (1966-70), had recommended the creation of the Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayukta in the states and the Centre is yet to get a
                                Lokpal. The Lokayukta is created as a statutory authority with a fixed tenure to qualify it to discharge its functions
                                independently and impartially and the person appointed is usually a former High Court Chief Justice or former Supreme Court
                                judge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the State of Karnataka, the history of the Lokayukta institution could be traced back to 1978 when Justice C. Honnaiah, a
                                former Chief Justice of Rajasthan High Court, was appointed the first Lokayukta under an ordinance which was short lived. The
                                Ordinance was allowed to lapse. However, when the Janata Party came in to power in 1983 as a fulfillment of its election pledge
                                made to the people for ―clean and value based policies‖, the R K Hegde Government introduced a Bill in the legislature in March
                                1983.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Bill was aimed at ending political and administrative corruption. Even after the passage of the Bill and the clearance of
                                the Union Government in October 1983, the functioning was delayed as none in the panel of names approved by the Government and
                                the leader of the opposition was ready to head it. This led to the creation of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984. Justice A.D.
                                Koshal, a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India, was sworn in as the Lokayukta on 15th January 1986.

                                Unless judges have some long-term security of tenure, there is a serious risk that their independence will be compromised, since
                                they may be more vulnerable to inappropriate influence in their decision-making. To begin with, in all the states the term of

                                The word "Lokpal" is derived from the sanskrit word "loka" meaning people and "pala" meaning protector or caretaker. Together it
                                means "protector of people". The aim of passing such a law is it to eradicate corruption at all levels of the Indian polity. For
                                a nation to develop it needs to have an extremely well organized and meticulously planned organization.

                                A failure of the administrative set up reflects on the holistic growth of the state, the biggest reason for the failure of the
                                administration can be attributed to the ill effects of corruption. The growth of the country has been plagued by corruption and
                                it has extended its wings through out the entire administrative set up. To root out the menace of corruption the institution of
                                "ombudsman" came up and has played a great role in fighting administrative malpractices.
