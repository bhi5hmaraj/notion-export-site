                                The WTO establishes a framework for trade policies, it does not define or specify the outcomes. That is, it is concerned with
                                setting the rules of the trade policy. Five principles are of particular importance for the WTO - Non Discrimination,
                                reciprocity, enforceable commitments, transparency and safety valves
                            </p>
                            <h1>Non Discrimination</h1>
                            <p>
                                Non discrimination is built on two components namely most favoured nation and the national treatment policy. Most favoured
                                nation principles require that member nations confer uniform trade conditions to other member nations. National treatment is the
                                policy that imports should not endure discrimination relative to domestic products. This principle addresses non tariff trade
                                barriers.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Most Favoured Nation Principle</h2>
                            <p>
                                The principle of Most Favored Nation (popularly known as the MFN treatment) by name implies
                                <br />
                                especially favourable treatment. The MFN principle is a fundamental principle of trade ensuring
                                <br />
                                non-discrimination between ‘like’ goods and services. It is a legal obligation to accord equal
                                <br />
                                treatment to all nations accorded the benefits. It means that no member country should give special treatment to any particular
                                trading partner, giving them an unfair advantage over others.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In simple terms, the MFN principle is like a rule that says, "If you give a special deal to one country, you have to give the
                                same deal to all other countries." This ensures that all countries have the same opportunities and are not unfairly favored by
                                any one country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if a country gives a lower tariff (tax) on goods from one country, it must give the same lower tariff to all other
                                countries. This way, all countries are treated equally, and no one country has an unfair advantage over others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is a principle adopted both in the GATT and the WTO.(Article I:1 of GATT, 1994) This principle is required to be followed by
                                all countries that are member nations of the WTO. It provides for non-discrimination amongst trading partners; and applies to
                                every governmental measure in the form of customs duties and charges, the method of levying the same and the rules and
                                formalities applicable in the importation and exportation of goods.

                                elaborates the scope of discrimination, and the phrase “any advantage, favor, privilege or immunity”. In this dispute, the issue
                                was whether Belgium had violated the MFN principle because of EU levying a charge on exports but not for Belgium since they had
                                a family allowance policy which exempted them from those charges. As a result, Denmark and Norway had to pay a charges on
                                exports since they did not have the same policy as Belgium. The Panel held that this was violative of Article I:1 of GATT, 1994.

                                The principle of most-favored nation under Article I: 1 of the GATT covers the following types
                                <br />
                                of governmental measures:

                                <strong>Customs and Duties</strong>
                                - Any kind of customs and duties (for example, transport or warehouse
                                <br />
                                charges) which are required for free and fair trade; and must be imposed on or in applied in connection with the imports and
                                exports
                                <br />

                                - The charge imposed on the internal transfer of payments for imports or exports is also coverd under this Artice. Hence,
                                suppose a Member charges a different exchange rate or service charge on the importation or exportation of goods only for a
                                particular WTO Member in a discriminatory manner, the measure is in violation of Article I: 1.

                                - This measure refers to the method used to calculate the duties and charges. If a WTO member uses different duties on the
                                (like) products imported or exported to some Members, while imposing specific duties on similar products; the same would be
                                considered as a different method of levying duties and charges.

                                - this means that rules and formalities with respect to importation and exportation of like products must be uniform for all
                                Members so as to maintain a level playing field.

                                - This clause does not apply to rules put forth in a custom union. Custom union is a substitution of a single customs territory
                                for two or more customs territory so that duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce are eliminated of products

                                in products originating from such countries.

                                goods, national treatment means that, once imported products have cleared customs and applicable tariff or duty has been
                                collected, they must be treated the same as domestic products
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This applies to various aspects of trade, including the treatment of imported goods once they enter the market, foreign and
                                domestic services, and foreign and local trademarks, copyrights, and patents. The basic rule is that no law, regulation or
                                taxation pattern adversely modifies the conditions of competition between like imported and domestic products in the domestic
                                market.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example - If Country A provides special tax breaks for its fledgling pharmaceutical industry, all pharmaceutical companies that
                                have operations in Country A will be entitled to the tax breaks, regardless of whether the company is domestic or foreign.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                National treatment applies to products even whose tariffs are not bound. National Treatment includes Internal taxes and charges
                                laws regulations and requirements affecting transportation, distribution for use of products and internal quantitative
                                regulation
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The national treatment clause is an essential component of many international trade agreements, including the World Trade
                                Organization (WTO) agreements. It is found in Article 3 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Article 17 of the
                                General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and Article 3 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
                                Rights (TRIPS).

                            <h3>Significance of the National Treatment Provision</h3>
                            <p>
                                The principle of National Treatment has the goal to prohibit discrimination between domestic and imported goods and services
                                that are like. In essence, the principle of national treatment seeks to promote trade liberalization.
                                <br />
                                Article III of the GATT, 1947 aims and endeavors to achieve the following:
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>It seeks to promote the conditions of competition between countries .</strong>
                                In the Japan – Alcoholic Beverages Case, the Appellate body held that “the fundamental purpose of the Principle of national
                                treatment is to prevent protectionism in the application of internal tax and regulatory measures.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                National treatment entails to improve the conditions of competition in the market, and any protectionism afforded to imported
                                production shall directly hamper the conditions of competition. Prejudices against goods that are not locally made are
                                considered to be unfair trade practices; with the principle of national treatment ensuring that free trade is fair and fair
                                trade is free.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>It seeks to ensure that imported goods are not subjected to any discrimination</strong>
                                either in the form of internal taxes or internal charges and laws,regulations and requirements…is not applied in such a manner
                                so as to afford protection to domestic production. Hence, national treatment ensures that imported goods will be afforded the
                                same treatment as domestic goods in matters that are under the control of the government.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>It helps in achieving liberalization through gradual reductions.</strong>
                                Even if tariff reductions were made as a result of trade negotiations, and if domestic taxes and regulations were to be applied
                                in a discriminatory fashion to protect domestic industry simultaneously, then effective internal trade barriers would remain.
                                The national treatment principle prohibits countries from using domestic taxes and regulations to offset the value of tariff
                                concessions and is, therefore, a significant tool in promoting trade liberalization.

                            <p>
                                In
                                <strong>Korea-Beef</strong>
                                case, the appellate body considered whether Korea was infringing
                                <br />
                                the national treatment of obligation by maintaining a dual retail system for marketing beef that

                                can find sales of imported beef to specialized stores. Korean law created two distinct retail
                                <br />
                                distribution system for beef. One for domestic true beef and another for imported beef. A large
                                <br />
                                retailer could sell both domestic and imported beef as long as it maintained separate sale areas.
                                <br />
                                Retailers selling imported beef were required to display a sign reading “Specialised Imported
                                <br />
                                Beef Store”.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The appellate body held that this in itself was not violative of Article III since the actions of korea did not provide enough
                                “reduction of competitve opportunity” to be violative.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Reciprocity</h1>
                            <p>
                                Reciprocity is a fundamental element of the negotiaing process. It reflects both a desire to limit the scope of free-riding that
                                may arise because of the MFN rule and a desire to obtain payment for trade liberalization in the form of better access to
                                foreign markets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although non discrimination principle reduces favouritism, it is possible that a nation grants favours to all other nations
                                without earning favours in return. This is called as freeriding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By requiring reciprocity, the WTO hopes to push nations away from free riding. Furthermore, this principle is designed to
                                realise the gains from trade that can be exploited when negotiated terms confer better outcomes than unilateral trade
                                liberalisation.

                            <h1>Binding and Enforceable Commitments</h1>
                            <p>
                                Under the WTO agreements, the member countries ‘bind’ their commitment at the agreement of opening up their market for goods. To
                                increase the amount of trade under binding
                                <br />
                                commitments was one of the motives of the Uruguay round of WTO. Binding refers to ceilings on customs tariff level for a
                                particular product that is committed
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These are commitments that signatory nations make when engaged in multilateral negotiations and then upon accession to the WTO.
                                Changing commitments means that other WTO members would incur costs which constitute losses to trade. This incidence is to be
                                accompanied by compensations. If attempts to meet this principle are unsatisfactory, signatory nations can seek redress through
                                the WTO dispute settlement procedures.

                            <p>
                                The principle of Transparency binds nations to commitments to build trade institutions that are easy to scrutinise, whose
                                decisions can be assessed, whose functions are documented and easy to report, whose communications to the WTO are timely and
                                clearly explained. These institutions are also required to report frequently and to respond to requests for information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through its Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the WTO prepares and utilises country level trade policy reviews to assess the state
                                and direction of trade policy. Transparency allows the WTO to facilitate trade by ensuring that member nations uphold WTO
                                principles. he WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of&nbsp;

                                Dumping, is a term used in international trade law to refer to the practice where a country exports goods into another country
                                at a price lower than the normal value in the exporting country's market. This is considered unfair trade because it can harm
                                the importing country's domestic industry by undercutting local prices, leading to potential job losses and business closures.
                                The remedy against dumping is the imposition of anti-dumping duties, which are additional tariffs to protect the domestic
                                industry from the negative effects of these low-priced imports.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anti-dumping is a measure taken by a country to counteract the negative effects of dumping. Dumping can cause significant
                                distortions in international trade, leading to unfair competition and potentially harming domestic industries. Anti-dumping
                                duties are taxes imposed on imported goods to compensate for the difference between their export price and their normal value,
                                if dumping causes injury to producers of competing products in the importing country
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, established the legal framework for addressing dumping
                                in international trade. Anti-dumping measures have evolved, with the Kennedy round of negotiations in the 1960s introducing the
                                first anti-dumping policies. These were further refined during the Tokyo round in the 1970s and the Uruguay round in the 1980s
                                and 1990s, which led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO's Anti-Dumping Agreement now governs the
                                application of anti-dumping duties, aiming to neutralize the adverse effects of dumped imports. The agreement requires a
                                thorough investigation to establish dumping and its impact on the domestic industry before any duties can be imposed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently, The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Anti-Dumping (ADA) is followed. This Agreement is a comprehensive
                                framework that outlines the rules and procedures for countries to follow when dealing with anti-dumping measures. These measures
                                are designed to protect domestic industries from the negative effects of dumping, which is the practice of exporting goods at a
                                price lower than their normal value in the exporting country.

                                The GATT Article VI sets the basic principles to be followed by the WTO Members when

                            <p>According to this provision, there must be three requirements for imposition of anti dumping measures:</p>

                                Article 15 of the Antidumping Agreement recognizes that special regard must be given by developed country members to the special
                                situation of developing country members when considering the application of anti-dumping measures under this agreement.
                                Possibilities of constructive remedies provided for by this agreement shall be explored before applying antidumping duties where
                                they would affect essential interest of developing country members.

                            <p>
                                In June 2015, American steel companies&nbsp;United States Steel Corp., Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics Inc., ArcelorMittal USA, AK
                                Steel Corp., and California Steel Industries, Inc. filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the ITC. Their
                                complaint alleged that several countries, including China, were dumping steel into the U.S. market and keeping prices unfairly

                            </p>

                                After conducting a review, one year later the U.S. announced that it would be imposing a total of 522% combined anti-dumping
                                and&nbsp;

                            <h2>Purpose of imposing Anti-Dumping Measures</h2>
                            <h3><strong>Protecting Domestic Industry</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                The primary objective of anti-dumping is to protect domestic industries from serious injury caused by dumping practices. Dumping
                                can lead to a significant decline in the domestic industry's market share, sales, and profitability. Anti-dumping duties are
                                designed to offset the negative effects of dumping by imposing a tariff on the dumped products, making them more expensive for
                                consumers and thereby reducing the competitive advantage of the dumped products.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Safeguarding Economic Stability</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Safeguarding economic stability is another important objective of anti-dumping. Dumping can have a significant impact on the
                                overall economy, particularly if it leads to the decline or collapse of a key industry. This can result in job losses, reduced
                                economic output, and increased social costs. Anti-dumping duties can help to safeguard economic stability by preventing the
                                collapse of a key industry. By imposing a tariff on dumped products, the government can help to maintain the viability of the
                                domestic industry, thereby preserving jobs and economic output.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Promoting Fair Competition</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Promoting fair competition is also an important objective of anti-dumping. Dumping can lead to unfair competition, as foreign
                                companies are able to sell their products at prices that are lower than their normal value. This can make it difficult for
                                domestic companies to compete, leading to a decline in their market share and profitability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anti-dumping duties can help to promote fair competition by leveling the playing field. By imposing a tariff on dumped products,
                                the government can help to ensure that domestic companies have a fair chance of competing with foreign companies. This can lead
                                to increased competition, innovation, and economic efficiency.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Deterrence of Dumping</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                The threat of anti-dumping duties can discourage exporters from engaging in dumping practices in the first place. The imposition
                                of anti-dumping duties makes dumping financially unattractive for exporters. These additional duties increase the cost of their
                                exports to the importing country, potentially eroding or eliminating the price advantage they sought to gain through dumping.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mere threat of being subjected to an anti-dumping investigation and potential duties can discourage exporters from engaging
                                in dumping practices. These investigations can damage a company's reputation.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Factors For Implementing Anti-Dumping Measures</h2>
                            <p><strong>Material Injury:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Anti-dumping measures are imposed to address the material injury caused to the domestic industry of the importing country.
                                Material injury refers to significant harm or threat of harm to the domestic industry, such as reduced production, sales,
                                profits, or employment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Article 3.4 requires National anti dumping authorities to consider for all relevant economic
                                <br />
                                factors and indices having a bearing in the state of the industry, including actual and potential
                                <br />
                                decline in sales, profits, output, market share, productivity return on investment, or utilization of
                                <br />
                                capacity, factors affecting domestic prices, the magnitude of the margin of dumping, actual and
                                <br />
                                potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise
                                <br />
                                capital or investment.

                            <p>
                                There must be a causal link established between the dumping and the material injury suffered by the domestic industry. The
                                injury must be a result of the dumped imports flooding the market and causing adverse effects on the domestic producers. It is
                                important to demonstrate that the dumping practices have directly led to the harm suffered by the domestic industry.

                                Anti-dumping measures are not imposed arbitrarily but are established through a comprehensive investigation. The investigating
                                authority of the importing country conducts an investigation to gather evidence, analyze data, and determine whether the
                                conditions for the imposition of anti-dumping duties have been met. This investigation includes collecting information from
                                relevant parties, such as the exporters, importers, and domestic industry, and allowing them to present their arguments and
                                evidence.
                            </p>

                                Article 5.2 of the Antidumping Agreement requires the National anti dumping authorities may
                                <br />
                                initiate an anti-dumping investigation when a domestic industry files a petition or on their own.
                                <br />
                                The petition must include evidence of dumping, material injury and causation that is reasonably
                                <br />
                                available t o the petitioner. The application must contain sufficient evidence of the existence of dumping that causes or
                                threatens to cause injury to a domestic industry.

                                Further, the antidumping agreement sets a maximum period for an anti dumping investigation to be conducted within one (1) year
                                and not exceed 18 months.

                            <p>
                                While the primary objective of anti-dumping measures is to protect domestic industries, the public interest of the importing
                                country is also taken into account. When establishing anti-dumping measures, the investigating authority considers factors such
                                as the impact on consumers, availability of supply, competition, and other relevant public interest considerations.

                                The World Trade Organization (WTO) is responsible for maintaining the free flow of trade between its member countries. The World
                                Trade Organization settles international trade disputes with a multi-step process outlined in the Dispute Settlement
                                Understanding (DSU) agreed to by member nations in 1994. The process includes various stages of consultation between the member
                                nations, the formation of an Dispute Settlement Panel, examination of the member nations and third parties by the panel, the
                                issuance of a report, and, if necessary, authorized compensatory or retaliatory measures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This dispute settlement process is the outcome of the Uruguay round (1996-1994). This mechanism provides a speedy resolution of
                                a trade dispute. This settlement system applies to all disputes covered under the WTO agreement. The Dispute Settlement Body
                                (DSB) is responsible for DSU to resolve a dispute between parties.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Dispute Settlement Body</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Dispute settlement Body is a body established for resolving the disputes between the conflicting parties by overseeing the
                                entire dispute settlement mechanism. The General Council of WTO, which carry out the functions of the Ministerial Conference,
                                renders its obligations under the Dispute Settlement Understanding through Dispute Settlement Body. (Article 4.3 of the WTO
                                agreement)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Dispute Settlement Body consists of a Chairman and representatives of all WTO members (usually government representatives).
                                The Chairman is usually a leader of the permanent mission of one of the member countries of WTO. The Chairman is elected with
                                the consent of all WTO members.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Procedure</h1>
                            <p>
                                Ideally disputes are resolved through negotiations. If this is not possible, WTO Members can request the establishment of a
                                panel to settle the dispute. The panel will issue a report, which can subsequently be appealed before the WTO's Appellate Body
                                on questions of law.
                            </p>
                            <h2><strong>Stage 1: Consultations (Article 4 of the DSU)</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                Before referring any dispute to mediation or taking any other actions, both the WTO member countries shall affirm to resolve
                                their disputes through consultation. If a WTO member requests for consultation with another Member concerning measures affecting
                                the operations of the former member, the latter member must accept such request within a period 10 days after the date of
                                receipt of such request and shall enter into consultation within 30 days.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the consultation fails to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem within 60 days after the date of receipt of the
                                request for consultation, then the complaining party may request for construction of the panel. All such requests for
                                consultation and construction shall be notified in writing including reasons for such requests to the Dispute Settlement Body by
                                the complaining member.
                            </p>
                            <h2><strong>Stage 2: Establishment of Panels (Articles 6, 8 and 11 of the DSU)</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                If no satisfactory solution is reached through consultation between the member countries, the complaining member may request for
                                the establishment of panels in writing to the Dispute Settlement Body including a summary of the case and issues involved. The
                                panel is established at the second meeting of DSB at which request appears as an agenda item of the meeting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The function of the Panel is to aid the Dispute Settlement Body in resolving the matter in dispute. The panel assesses the
                                entire dispute, including the facts of the case and issues involved therein and examines whether it conforms with the covered
                                agreement between the member countries. The Panel shall provide its final report to the parties within 6 months from the date
                                when panel procedures start.
                            </p>
                            <h2><strong>Stage 3: Selection of panellists (Article 8 of the DSU)</strong></h2>
                            <p>
                                After the establishment of the panel, the next step is to select panellists. The panellists are selected by the WTO Secretariat.
                                The parties cannot oppose the selection unless they state reasons satisfactory to the Secretariat. The panel shall consist of
                                three panellists. The parties can agree to have five panellists on board if they consider necessary within 10 days from the
                                establishment of the panel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The WTO Secretariat assists the parties in the selection of panellists by creating a list of all governmental and
                                non-governmental individuals having certain qualifications from which panellists may be chosen by the parties.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Members may, at any reasonable time, make an addition to the list of individuals by suggesting the name of individuals who can
                                assist the parties by providing any information related to international trade law or any of the matter as covered in the
                                agreement because of which dispute arose in the first place. The addition to the list can be made only after the approval of the
                                Dispute Settlement Body.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Composition of the panel:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The panel generally consists of three panellists but can be a maximum of five, if the parties consider it necessary. (Article
                                8.5 of the DSU)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Panel shall consist of well-qualified governmental and non-governmental individuals, including the persons who have served a
                                panel or presented a case to a panel. The panellists shall be from amongst the persons who have served as a representative of a
                                member or a contracting party to GATT, 1947 or as a representative to the Council or Committee of any covered agreement or its
                                predecessor agreement, or in the Secretariat, taught or published on international trade law or policy, or served as a senior
                                trade policy official of a member.

                                The panellists shall, within one week after the composition of the panel fix a timetable for the panel process. After this, the
                                panel decides a deadline for written submission to be made by each party. Each party has to submit its submissions with the
                                secretariat which shall transfer each submission to the panel and submission made by one party shall be sent to the other party
                                as well. At the first substantive meeting of the panel, the complaining party shall be the first to present their case ahead of
                                the responding party.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The third parties who have notified the Dispute Settlement Body having substantial interest in the subject matter of the dispute
                                are also asked to present their views during the same meeting. Any rebuttals between the parties shall be made at the subsequent
                                meeting of the panel. Here, the responding party shall be the first to respond against the complaining party. The parties,
                                before that meeting, have to submit their written rebuttals to the panel. The panel, if they consider necessary, put any
                                questions before the parties to be answered in the duration of that meeting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where after the examination, a solution has been reached between the parties, the panel shall submit a written report to the
                                Dispute Settlement Body which shall have a brief description of the case along with the solution which has been reached. Where
                                the solution has not been found, the panel shall send a written report to the Dispute Settlement Body mentioning its findings of
                                the case and recommendations, if any, it makes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The report has to be sent within
                                <strong>six months</strong>
                                of its examination. In case of urgency, including the case of perishable goods, the report has to be sent within three months.
                                The maximum period during which the report has to send is nine months from the establishment of the panel.

                                At the request made by the parties, the panel shall call for a further meeting to discuss the comments made by the parties to
                                the dispute. If both the parties are satisfied with the solution reached, then such a revised interim report shall be the final

                                At a DSB meeting to be held within 30 days after the adoption of the Panel report or Appellate Body report, the party concerned
                                must state its intentions in respect of the implementation of the DSB’s recommendations. The DSB will allow the concerned party
                                a reasonable period of time to implement the recommendations. In any event that reasonable period should not normally exceed 15
                                months from the report’s original date of adoption. In the event of a party’s failure to comply with the recommendations within
                                the set time, it must enter into negotiations with the complainant in order to decide on a mutually acceptable level of
                                compensation.

                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                                Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are quarantine and biosecurity measures which are applied to protect human, animal or
                                plant life or health from risks arising from the introduction, establishment and spread of pests and diseases and from risks
                                arising from additives, toxins and contaminants in food and feed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These measures are governed by the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
                                Measures (the SPS Agreement), and its Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Committee).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The SPS Agreement provides a framework of rules to guide WTO Members in the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary
                                (human or animal life or health) and phytosanitary (plant life or health) measures which may affect trade.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SPS agreement has been built on previous GATT rules to restrict the use of unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary measures for
                                the purpose of trade protection. The basic aim of the SPS Agreement is to maintain the sovereign right of any government to
                                provide the level of health protection it deems appropriate, but to ensure that the sovereign rights are not misused for
                                protectionist purposes and do not result in unnecessary barriers to international trade.

                                The right to adopt SPS measures is accompanied by obligations aimed at minimizing negative impacts of SPS measures on
                                international trade. The basic obligations are that SPS measures must:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="bulleted-list">

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                                    be based on scientific principles and not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence; and
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                                    not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable treatment or a disguised restriction on international trade.

                                Further the Agreement sets limitations on member states polices relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides,
                                inspection and labeling) as well as animal and plant health (phytosanitation), specifically with respect to imported pests and
                                diseases. Thus, the Agreement aims to provide the balance between the right of governments to protect food safety, plant and
                                animal health, and prevent these sanitary and phytosanitary measures from being unjustified trade barriers.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Justification</h3>
                            <p>
                                SPS agreement has been built on previous GATT rules to restrict the use of unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary measures for
                                the purpose of trade protection. The basic aim of the SPS Agreement is to maintain the sovereign right of any government to
                                provide the level of health protection it deems appropriate, but to ensure that the sovereign rights are not misused for
                                protectionist purposes and do not result in unnecessary barriers to international trade. Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, by
                                their very nature, may result in restrictions on trade. All governments accept the fact that some trade restrictions may be
                                necessary to ensure food safety and animal and plant health protection.
                            </p>
                            <h3>International standards</h3>
                            <p>
                                The SPS Agreement encourages governments to establish national SPS measures consistent with international standards, guidelines
                                and recommendations. This process is often referred to as "harmonization". The WTO itself does not and will not develop such
                                standards. However, most of the WTO’s member governments participate in the development of these standards in other
                                international bodies. The standards are developed by leading scientists in the field and governmental experts on health
                                protection and are subject to international scrutiny and review.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                International standards are often higher than the national requirements of many countries, including developed countries, but
                                the SPS Agreement explicitly permits governments to choose not to use the international standards.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Adapting to conditions&nbsp;</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Agreement takes into account the varying factors like climate, existing pests or diseases, or
                                <br />
                                food safety conditions of a geographical area. It is not always appropriate to impose the same sanitary and phytosanitary
                                requirements on food, animal or plant products coming from different countries. Therefore, the sanitary and phytosanitary
                                measures sometimes vary, depending on the country of origin of the food, animal or plant product concerned. The Government
                                should also recognise disease free areas which may not correspond to political boundaries and appropriately adapt their
                                requirements to products from these areas.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
                            <p>
                                The SPS Agreement increases the transparency of sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
                                <br />
                                Countries must establish SPS measures on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the actual
                                <br />
                                risk involved and, if requested, make known what factors that took into consideration, the
                                <br />
                                assessment procedures they used and the level of risk they determined to be acceptable.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <h3>Transparency</h3>
                            <p>
                                Governments are required to notify other countries of any new or change sanitary and phytosanitary requirements which affect
                                trade. They also have to set up offices to respond to requests for more information on your existing measures. The systematic
                                communication of Information and exchange of experiences among the WTO member governments provide a better basis for national
                                standards. Such increased transparency also protects the interest of consumers as well as trading partners, from hidden
                                protectionism through unnecessary technical requirements.
